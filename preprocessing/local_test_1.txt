This document contains one lie. Hello, my name is Michael Gough, and I lack sanity. I grew up in the Midwest. I was born on December 23, 1989. I have an interest in endurance races and the mystery of conscious experience. My superpowers are the abilities to get bored quickly and to enjoy boredom. I have $100 in my bank account, and I drive a Toyota.
